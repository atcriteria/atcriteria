### ⚔️ Greetings, Adventurer 🛡️
I am a Full Stack Web Developer who enjoys creating unique web applications as well as dabbling a bit in game development both as an artist and a programmer.

## A little bit about me
- My love for programming and Full Stack Web Dev stems from my desire to create amazing things that users can interact with.
- I enjoy Python's simplicity but prefer JavaScript's structure. Something about semicolons and curly braces just really gets the heart racing.
- I love to make people laugh.

🛠 Tech Stack
- 💻 &nbsp; Python | MySQL
- 🌐 &nbsp; HTML | CSS | JavaScript | ReactJS
