### ‚öîÔ∏è Greetings, Adventurer üõ°Ô∏è
I am a Full Stack Web Developer who enjoys creating unique web applications as well as dabbling a bit in game development both as an artist and a programmer.

## üìñ A little bit about me
- My love for programming and Full Stack Web Dev stems from my desire to create amazing things that users can interact with.
- I enjoy Python's simplicity but prefer JavaScript's structure, especially in respect to white space and troubleshooting.
- I really love MongoDB and how simple it is to incorporate it into a project, but I have a very firm appreciation for relational databases.
- One of my favorite projects I contribute to is an ongoing Graphical MUD called [Wyvern](https://www.ghosttrack.com/).
- My childhood dream was to be a 3D environmental artist in the video game industry. Now I create with code, but I still dabble in pixel art from time to time.
- One of my goals in life is to create my own game and release it to the world. I plan on picking up Unity and C# either by the end of this year or early 2022!

## üõ† Tech Stack
- üíª &nbsp; Python | MySQL | MongoDB
- üåê &nbsp; HTML | CSS | JavaScript | ReactJS | NodeJS

## Current Project
[RPG Simulator 2](https://github.com/atcriteria/rpg-sim-fe)
This project is a recreation of [this](https://github.com/atcriteria/RPGProject) small project I made in vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS during my first month with Lambda school. [RPG Simulator 2](https://github.com/atcriteria/rpg-sim-fe) will be very simular except I will be building it with React and eventually integrating a back end and database to store player character data for stricter player integrity and possibly even leaderboards.

## Recent Project
MyMessenger, which is a simple instant messaging application consisting of a [front end](https://github.com/atcriteria/mymessenger-frontend) and a [back end](https://github.com/atcriteria/mymessenger-backend). The inspiration for this project was to learn a bit about websockets with Socket.io. This is one of my more styled applications, and is fully responsive in design. The application allows users to create a temporary display name which randomly assigns them a color scheme, and then allows them to send messages to the back end via websockets. The back end stores up to 50 of the most recent messages and delivers them to users when they access the application so they can catch up on all of the nonsense they might have missed. This project does not use a database and does not save or store any data of any kind.
